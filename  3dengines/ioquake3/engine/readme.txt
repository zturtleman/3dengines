Source Code Notes:
-------------------------------------------------------
Currently, basic changes are taking place to get ioquake where
I need it in order to be able to move over the changes that I
had previously done to the Evolution engine.


Current Changelog:
-----------------------------------------------

1. Mac + Linux support is almost gone. I need MSVC and support for windows only.

2. Checksum checks removed. Need to load any or all pak files



Current TODO List:
-----------------------------------------------

1. Remove vm support. I will be using .dll's.. Horde3D and other libraries will not work in a vm.

2. Incorporate snow, fog, rain, vehicle support and horde 3d from test version.
