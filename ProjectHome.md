Here you will find some Quake 3 Arena based projects that I have messed with at one time or another. I am working on a small tactical / deathmatch game simular to COD, MOHAA and so on. Because of this, I've checked out multiple Q3A Related Projects such as ioquake3, Xreal and Evolution.

PLEASE NOTE:
These are setup to be compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2005. Linux and Mac support is not something that I am interested in so most of the code has been removed for these platforms. The rendering engines and additional libraries for my own projects only support Windows at this time.

PAK NOTICE:
You will need the pak files from the Quake 3 Demo or OpenArena if you do not own a copy of Quake 3. For ioquake, Checksum checks have been removed so ioquake will now load either standard Quake 3 pak0.pk3 files or will load the pak files of any mods. However, You will more than likely be missing some of the original textures so if you do not own Quake 3, use the OpenArena pak files and install the q3a mods as usual.
